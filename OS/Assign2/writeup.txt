Homework 2 Write-up

I have completed this assignment and I believe I should get a 100.

This was built up from the last assignment, but with no signal handling and more pipe management with 
openings and closings.  After the first sort was completed, it was only a couple of minor changes to
make grep1 and grep2.

sort and grep1(the smaller one) ran as expected.  However, grep2 locked up.  This was because the 
data to go through was 250 times the size and overloaded the buffer that was used in the child.
This meant that the parent would keep feeding in more data, but the child would be unable to process it.
Then, the pipes would be overloaded and they would both lock each other out.  This issue was expected
and warned about.
