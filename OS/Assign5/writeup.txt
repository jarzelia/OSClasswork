I was unable to do the Buddy in the time given.  After testing the compiler and seeing that it didn't accept
ciel or log functions available in math, I said screw it.  I realize that bit shifting would have been an
easier way of getting the right sizes.

The first was an easy implementation and best was first, but with additional loops when you are looking for
the next space to put the info in.

As a result, I believe that I should get a 70 , since I completed two formats and made some progress on best.
