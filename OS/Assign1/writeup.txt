Homework 1 Write-up

I have completed this assignment to the best of my ability, and I believe I should get a 100.

This was a modification of assignment 7 from the architecture course along with some additions with 
from the assign1.c file given.  I took the signal handling code from there.  The child shutdown worked
without a problem and was not an issue.

However, I did run into some issues with the professor's program.  I was unable to kill the program
from inside of the original code.  However, if I suspended it, then input the kill command, everything
worked out as expected.  

output1.txt shows the program timing out because it wouldn't accept the kill, but output2.txt
shows it working after the suspension/reactivation.
