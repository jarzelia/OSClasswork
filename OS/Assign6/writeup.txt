Homework 6 Write-up

I have completed this assignment fully and I believe that I should get a 100.

The code is largely based on what we saw in class, with some modifications.  It works and does 
everything correctly.  

There are test directories and links included.

TEST TYPES:
regular file is any one of the programs
directory is . or the included test folder
symlink is the shortcut
block device I ran this program on /dev/sda
char device I ran this program on /dev/null

The output is included in output.txt
